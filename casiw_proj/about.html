          <h2 class="about-title">GIAN CASIW</h2>
          <p>
            I, Gian Mark Casiw, or known as, Gian. Was born in May 27 2006 and I am from Quezon City. 
            Studying in Our Lady of Fatima University, a 1st year College student and taking the course of Bachelor of Science in Information Technology, or known as IT. 
            I'm a creative web developer who thrives on building colorful, user-friendly websites that spread joy and good vibes wherever they go. 
            With a heart full of passion and a head full of code, I bring bright ideas to life through beautiful layouts, smooth animations, and seamless functionality.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether it's a personal blog, a small business site, or a whimsical online shop, I love turning visions into vibrant realities—like painting with pixels on a digital canvas. 
            Every line of code I write is sprinkled with a bit of sunshine and a lot of love. I believe websites should feel just as good as they look—welcoming, inspiring, and a little magical. 
            My goal is to create experiences that make people smile, feel seen, and maybe even dance a little inside. Think rainbows, glitter, and glowing buttons—wrapped up in clean code and a whole lot of enthusiasm!
